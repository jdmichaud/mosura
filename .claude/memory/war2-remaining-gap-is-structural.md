**⭐ MEASURED 2026-08-12 at 375 byte-clean (`classify_diffs.py`, results.m20).** Both instruction
streams are aligned with difflib over normalized mnemonics; each mismatch is classed by how many
divergent regions it has and what fraction of its instructions differ.

| class | count | share |
|---|---|---|
| STRUCTURAL (>40% of instructions differ) | 2111 | 81.2% |
| PARTIAL (<=40%) | 391 | 15.0% |
| LOCAL (1 region, <=3 instructions) | 78 | 3.0% |
| NEAR (<=2 regions, <=15%) | 19 | 0.7% |

**Only 97 functions are within one or two small regions of matching.** Reaching 600 from 375 needs
+225, so it CANNOT come from the near-miss tail — it requires converting ~46% of the 488
non-structural functions, or breaking into the structural bulk.

## What the closest 97 actually need (censused divergent regions)

    13  orig has trailing `8d 40 ..` (lea-NOP padding)   <- comparator, now fixed, gained 0
    10  orig: and eax,0xff        cand: (none)           <- byte-width parameter typing
     6  orig: mov eax,eax         cand: (none)           <- padding
     6  orig: ret                 cand: ret 0x4          <- caller-pop vs callee-pop convention
     5  orig: (none)              cand: mov ah,0x1
     4  orig: shl eax,0x2         cand: lea eax,[eax*4+0] <- peephole/instruction selection
     2  jbe/jae, jl/jle, jg/jge swaps                     <- condition-code recovery

A large share of these are INSTRUCTION SELECTION (peepholes) and comparator artefacts, not
decompiler defects. `add edx,0x12 ; mov eax,edx` vs `lea eax,[edx+0x12]` (FUN_00023210) is the
worked example: both return in EAX and the C is right; only codegen differs.

## Confounds ruled out along the way

- **"Functions preserving many registers are a class."** They are not: leading-push count is a
  proxy for function SIZE (median length 30 / 31 / 56 / 87 / 108 / 163 / 232 bytes for 0..6
  pushes). The low byte-clean rate at 4+ pushes is the low rate for big functions.
- **`modify exact []`** (Watcom's forcing form; plain `modify []` is inert) does produce the
  register saves, but sized on 120 functions it gave EXACT 0 -> 0 and mean |delta| 33.5 -> 34.0.
  Blunt instrument: it also saves registers the original does not, including `push gs`.

## The one thing that IS worth knowing

delta==0 is EMPTY: of 2509 mismatches not one has the original's length, while the neighbouring
buckets hold 70-96 each. Getting a function to the right LENGTH is very nearly equivalent to
getting it byte-clean. Length is the metric to chase.
